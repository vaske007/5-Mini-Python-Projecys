# 5-Mini-Python-Projects
Doing 5 mini python projects, actually 6.

I follow a tutorial from Tech with Tim and make the same 5 projects that he does, tho I do add 1 project that I made by myself. The chooser, the chooser is not included in the tutorial, and I have made it from scratch.

The 5 projects include:
- A quiz game
- A number guesser
- A rock, paper, scissors against the computer
- Choose your own adventure
- A password manager

Here is the link to the tutorial: https://youtu.be/DLn3jOsNRVE
